          About DEdC
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          DEdC is a team originated concept for CPE 495/496 working to create the next
          generation DFD modeling software. Though in its infancy, our
          team's goal is to bring DFD modeling into the 21st Century
          through a combination of deep understanding in team collaboration and
          extensibility techniques.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
          Why DFD editing?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          DFD creation is a major component of the current software or system design paradigm. If you are an I.T. professional
          deploying a network, or a development team creating new software, or an engineer designing a new mission-critical system, it
          is imperative that you understand the layout of your system before it
          comes under attack. DFD planning will play a crucial first step in this process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
          Our Software
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The DEdC tool is still in the early stages of development.
          We will soon be releasing a very early alpha
          with basic DFD editing functionality, including a team based, collaborative DFD editor.
